	<h1>My Apology to Shikha</h1>
	<p>Dear Shikha,</p>
	<p>I wanted to apologize for any discomfort or pressure I may have caused you by expressing my feelings. I value our friendship and I'm willing to take things at your pace. Please know that I don't expect you to reciprocate my feelings or feel obligated to continue the relationship in any way. I just wanted to express how I feel and apologize if I made you feel uncomfortable.</p>
	<p>Thank you for your understanding, and I hope we can continue our friendship if you feel comfortable doing so.</p>
