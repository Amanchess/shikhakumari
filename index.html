	<h1>Dear Shikha,</h1>
	<p>I wanted to take a moment to apologize for my recent behavior towards you. I understand that my actions may have caused you pain and discomfort, and for that, I am truly sorry.</p>
	<p>I value our friendship more than anything else, and I am willing to do whatever it takes to make things right between us. I understand that I may have made you feel uncomfortable, and I want to assure you that my intentions were never to hurt you or cause any distress.</p>
	<p>I hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me, and that we can move past this and continue to be great friends. If there's anything I can do to help mend our relationship, please don't hesitate to let me know.</p>
	<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this. Again, I am deeply sorry for any pain or discomfort I may have caused you.</p>
